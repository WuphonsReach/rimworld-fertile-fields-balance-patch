<!--
Original math for this is "1" stone chunk to "2" crushed rocks for workAmount 600.
Or "5" to "10" for the bulk recipe for 3000 workAmount.

- Increase conversion rate from 1:2 to 1:20
- Lower single recipe work amount by 5x
- Give a 20% reduction on work amount for bulk.

MakeCrushedRocksBlock is 10 blocks to 1 rock.  But stone chunks -> blocks is a 1:20 ratio.  
Plus the time to create the stone blocks.  So that chunk recipe should output 1:20.  
And the block to crushed rock recipe should output 1 rock per block instead of 1:10 rocks:blocks.
